Blockchain Developer and Smart Contract Auditor
BTech CSE (Prefinal Year)

## About Me

I am a blockchain developer and smart contract auditor with over two years of hands-on experience across Ethereum, Layer 2 networks, and Solana. My primary focus is smart contract security, including manual audits, protocol analysis, and competitive auditing. I work with a security-first mindset, aiming to understand systems deeply and identify real, practical vulnerabilities.

I am currently strengthening my expertise in Solana and Rust while actively participating in competitive audits and CTFs. I also have a strong interest in finance and long-term product building.
