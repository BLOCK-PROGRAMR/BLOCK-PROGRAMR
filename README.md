**Security Researcher | Blockchain Core Developer**

B.Tech CSE (Prefinal Year)

## About

Security-focused blockchain researcher with 2+ years of experience across Ethereum, Layer 2s, and Solana.

I approach protocols with an adversarial mindset — studying state transitions, cross-function interactions, and real exploit paths.

## Focus Areas

* Manual analysis and pattern observation
* Edge case discovery
* State transition analysis across cross-functions
* Behavior analysis under adversarial conditions
* Tool development for EVM and Solana security
